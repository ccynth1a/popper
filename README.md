## Introduction
Have you ever wanted to click circles for at least 7 hours? If yes, or no, then this is the game for you. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES. CLICK THE CIRCLES.  

*This entire project is the attempt of the two developers to learn Svelte. Do not expect anything particularly impressive, elegant or novel. This is simply to test as many features as possible in a ludicrously over-engineered application*
## Build Instructions
So far, there are no other dependencies than the usual Sveltekit ones, so simply build in the way you would normally expect to.
## Pull Requests
As of writing, this repository is private, but I ask the common courtesy that you please do not make pull requests as this is a personal project
